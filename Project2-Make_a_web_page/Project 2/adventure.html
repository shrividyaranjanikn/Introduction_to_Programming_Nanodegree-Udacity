<div class="introduction">An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience. It may also be a bold, usually risky undertaking,
     with an uncertain outcome. Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as
     traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting or participating in extreme sports.
     The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial or psychological
     risk, such as a business venture, or other major life undertakings.Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal,
     which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. fear) or positive (e.g. flow). For some people, adventure becomes a major
     pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer Andre Malraux, in his La Condition Humaine (1933), "If a man is not ready
     to risk his life, where is his dignity?". Similarly, Helen Keller stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.
     Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure
     racing and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers
     and pioneers , the British adventurer Jason Lewis, for example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living
     within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. Adventure education intentionally uses challenging
     experiences for learning.</div>
<div class="adventure1">Bungy jumping is an activity that involves jumping from a tall<br/>
    structure while connected to a large elastic cord.the tall<br/>
    structure is usually a fixed objet,such as building ,bridge<br/>
    ;but but it is also possible to jump from a movable object,<br/>
    as a hot-air ballon, that has the ability to hover above the<br/>
    ground. the thrill comes from the free-falling and rebound<br/></div>
<div class="adventure2">Caving also traditionally known as spelunking in the United States and
    Canada and potholing in the United Kingdom and Ireland is the recreational pastime of
    exploring wild (generally non-commercial) cave systems. In contrast, speleology is the
    scientific study of caves and the cave environment.The challenges involved in caving vary according
    to the cave being visited, but in addition to the total absence of light beyond the entrance often include
    the negotiation of pitches, squeezes, and water hazards.Cave diving is a distinct, and more hazardous, sub-speciality
    undertaken by a small minority of technically proficient cavers. In an area of overlap between recreational pursuit and
   scientific study, the most devoted and serious-minded cavers become accomplished at the surveying and mapping of caves and the formal
   (though usually private) publication of their efforts.<br/>

<div class="adventure3">Parachuting, or skydiving, is a method of transiting from a high point to Earth with the aid of gravity,
      involving the control of speed during the descent with the use of a parachute. It may involve
      more or less free-fall, a time during which the parachute has not been deployed and the body
      gradually accelerates to terminal velocity.<br/></div>
<div class="adventure4">The act or method of moving down a steep incline or past an overhang
       by means of a double rope secured above and placed around the body, usually under the left thigh and
       over the right shoulder, and paid out gradually in the descent.
       Famous in Maryland.<br/></div>
<div class="adventure5">Skiing can be a means of transport, a recreational activity
or a competitive winter sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow.
Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS).</div>
<div class="adventure6">Come face-to-face with sharks 3 miles (4.8 km) off the shore of Oahu.
      With a snorkel and mask, dive into the Pacific Ocean to view sharks in their natural
      environment from the comfort and safety of a custom-built cage.After a safety briefing
      ,depart from the Haleiwa Boat Harbor and head out to sea. Take in the North Shore vistas
      on this gentle ride in a custom-made boat with covered, cushioned seating. Once at the
      shark viewing area, the cage is placed in the water. It floats at the surface, and when
      you enter the water you can choose to float or dive a few feet down while still in the
      safety of the cage.With visibility that can reach 150 feet (45 m) or more, you can see
      the sharks come up from the deep,cobalt-blue depths of the ocean. Watch as sharks ranging
      from 5 to 15 feet (1.5 to 4.5 m) in length circleonly inches away from the cage.
      Viewing the sharks in their natural environment is a true wonder. Expect to see gray
      reef sharks, Galapagos sharks, sandbar sharks, or hammerhead sharks, all with unique traits
      that your guide shares through informative narration.<br/>
