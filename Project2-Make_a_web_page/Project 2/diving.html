    <span style="color:black; font-family:arial">Parachuting, or skydiving, is a method of transiting from a high point to Earth with the aid of gravity,
      involving the control of speed during the descent with the use of a parachute. It may involve
      more or less free-fall, a time during which the parachute has not been deployed and the body
      gradually accelerates to terminal velocity.<br/></span>
