    <br/><span style="color:white; font-family:arial">Caving also traditionally known as spelunking in the United States and
    Canada and potholing in the United Kingdom and Ireland is the recreational pastime of
    exploring wild (generally non-commercial) cave systems. In contrast, speleology is the
    scientific study of caves and the cave environment.The challenges involved in caving vary according
    to the cave being visited, but in addition to the total absence of light beyond the entrance often include
    the negotiation of pitches, squeezes, and water hazards.Cave diving is a distinct, and more hazardous, sub-speciality
    undertaken by a small minority of technically proficient cavers. In an area of overlap between recreational pursuit and
   scientific study, the most devoted and serious-minded cavers become accomplished at the surveying and mapping of caves and the formal
   (though usually private) publication of their efforts.<br/></span>
