    <span style="color:white;font-family:arial">Come face-to-face with sharks 3 miles (4.8 km) off the shore of Oahu.
      With a snorkel and mask, dive into the Pacific Ocean to view sharks in their natural
      environment from the comfort and safety of a custom-built cage.After a safety briefing
      ,depart from the Haleiwa Boat Harbor and head out to sea. Take in the North Shore vistas
      on this gentle ride in a custom-made boat with covered, cushioned seating. Once at the
      shark viewing area, the cage is placed in the water. It floats at the surface, and when
      you enter the water you can choose to float or dive a few feet down while still in the
      safety of the cage.With visibility that can reach 150 feet (45 m) or more, you can see
      the sharks come up from the deep,cobalt-blue depths of the ocean. Watch as sharks ranging
      from 5 to 15 feet (1.5 to 4.5 m) in length circleonly inches away from the cage.
      Viewing the sharks in their natural environment is a true wonder. Expect to see gray
      reef sharks, Galapagos sharks, sandbar sharks, or hammerhead sharks, all with unique traits
      that your guide shares through informative narration.<br/>
